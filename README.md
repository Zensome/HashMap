# Hash Map Implementations in Python

Portfolio assignment for Data Structures course I took at OSU. The assignment is to implement hashmap without built-in data structures in Python.

## Files

- `a6_include.py`: Contains necessary data structures used in both hash map implementations.
- `hash_map_sc.py`: Implements a hash map using separate chaining for collision resolution.
- `hash_map_oa.py`: Implements a hash map using open addressing (quadratic probing) for collision resolution.

## Concepts Covered

- **Hash Functions**: Understanding and utilizing hash functions.
- **Collision Resolution**: Implementing separate chaining and open addressing methods, and quadratic probing.
- **Dynamic Arrays and Linked Lists**: Using both dynamic arrays and linked lists in the implementation of hash maps.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) time complexity for hash map operations.
